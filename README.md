# recklessrashdan.github.io

Hi, welcome to my personal website!  
I'm 16 years old and created this site to share my projects, interests, and a bit about myself. The site is built and hosted using GitHub Pages. All the files you see here are what make the website work.

## What’s Here

- Updates on things I’m learning or building
- My coding projects and experiments
- A place for me to practice web development

## How It Works

- Visit the website: https://recklessrashdan.github.io/
- If you want to see how it works, clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/recklessrashdan/recklessrashdan.github.io.git
  ```
- Any changes I push show up on the site right away!

Thanks for visiting!
